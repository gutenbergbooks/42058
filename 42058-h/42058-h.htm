<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Narrative poetry is distinguished from other types
of verse in that it aims to relate a connected series of
events and, therefore, deals primarily with actions,
rather than with thoughts or emotions. This definition,
however, simple as it appears to be in theory, is
often difficult to apply as a test because other matter
is blended with the pure narrative. In any story where
the situation is made prominent, description may be
required to make clear the scene and explain movements
to the reader; thus <i>Enoch Arden</i> begins with a
word picture of a sea-coast town. Again it is often
necessary to analyze the motives which actuate certain
characters, and so it becomes necessary to introduce
exposition of some sort into the plot. The poems in
this collection serve to enforce the lesson that the four
standard rhetorical forms&mdash;narration, description,
exposition, and argumentation&mdash;are constantly being
combined and welded in a complicated way. In cases
where these various literary elements are apparently
in a tangle, a classification, if it be made at all, must
be based on the design of the poem as a whole, and
the emphasis and proportion given to the respective
elements by the author. If the stress is laid on the recounting
of the events which make up a unified action,
and if the other factors are made subordinate and subsidiary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
to this end, then the poem in question belongs
to the narrative group.</p>

<p>The antiquity of the narrative as a form of literature
is undisputed. Indeed it has been established with a
reasonable degree of certainty that poetry in its very
beginnings was narrative and in its primitive state
must have been a sort of rude, rhythmical chant, originated
and participated in by the tribe as a whole, and
telling of the exploits of gods or legendary heroes.
In the course of time there arose the <i>minstrel</i>, who, acting
first as chorus leader, became eventually the representative
of the tribe and its own special singer. When
we reach a somewhat more advanced stage of civilization,
we find regularly appointed bards reciting their
lays in the hall of the chieftain or urging on the warriors
to battle with rehearsals of past victories. Originally
these bards simply repeated the old oral traditions
handed down as common property, but the opportunity
for the display of individual genius soon induced them
to try variations on the current themes and to compose
versions of their own. With this advance of individualism,
poetry became gradually more complex.
Various elements, lyrical, descriptive, and dramatic,
assumed some prominence and tended to develop
separate forms. This differentiation, however, did
not impair the vigor of the story-telling spirit, and a
constant succession of narrative poems down to the
present day evidences how productive and characteristic
a feature of our literature this form has been.</p>

<p>Obviously it is impracticable to undertake here even
a brief summary of the history of English narrative
poetry and of the influences to which it has been responsive.
Something may, nevertheless, be done to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
map out roughly a few divisions which may be of
assistance in bringing this material into orderly shape for
the student. Many efforts at systematic classification
have been made, and a few fairly well-marked types
have been defined. In spite of this fact, the task still
presents insuperable obstacles over which there has been
futile controversy. One type is likely to run into
another in a way which is uncomfortably baffling.
Then there are numerous nondescript works whose
proper place seems determinable by no law of poetics.
The fact is that, here at least, narrow distinctions
are bound to be unsatisfactory. The critic finds it
imperative to avoid dogmatism lest he lay himself open
to attack; his only refuge is in the general statement
which may be suggestive even if it is not exact.</p>

<p>Of the fixed types, two of the best known, the <i>Epic</i>
and the <i>Ballad</i>, were among the earliest to be created.
The Epic in its original form was a long poem of uniform
metre, serious in tone and elevated in style, introducing
supernatural or heroic characters and usually
dealing with some significant event in racial or national
history. In its first or primitive shape it was
anonymous, a spontaneous outgrowth of popular feeling,
though perhaps arranged and revised at a later date
by some conscious artistic hand. Such a primitive Epic
is the old English <i>Beowulf</i>: it is thoroughly objective;
in it no clew to definite authorship can be detected;
in it personality is buried in the rush of incident and
the clash of action. When, with the broadening of
the scope of poetry, the individual writer displaced the
tribe as the preserver of folk-lore, the new order of
things evolved the so-called artificial Epic as represented
by Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>. Here the conventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Epic style and material is kept; the universe
is the stage, and the figures upon it are imposing and
grand; but behind the poem is a single personality
whose mood colors and modifies the whole. The Epic
is no longer entirely racial or national, but individual;
and we have the introduction of such passages as Milton's
reference to his own blindness in Book Three.</p>

<p>Akin to the Epic is the Mock Epic, which appropriates
the Epic machinery and Epic style to use them in
dealing with trivialities. In Pope's <i>The Rape of the
Lock</i>, the most artistic Mock Epic in English, the theft
of a single lock of hair becomes an act of national and
supernatural interest and a game of cards is described
as if it were a mighty battle.</p>

<p>Almost parallel with and closely resembling the
development of the Epic is that of the <i>Ballad</i>. Like
the primitive Epic in anonymity and impersonality,
the Ballad was much shorter, had rime and stanzas,
and dealt, as a rule, with incidents of less importance.
Not so formal or pretentious as the Epic,
it was easily memorized even by the peasant, and
handed down from generation to generation by word
of mouth. Favorite subjects were the legends of
Robin Hood, the misfortunes of nobles, and the incidents
of Border warfare. Mixed in many of them was a
tendency toward superstition, a survival of the belief
in ghosts, magicians, and talking animals. Numerous
examples gathered by antiquaries may be found in the
edition of old English Ballads in this series; among the
better known are <i>The Wife of Usher's Well</i> and <i>Chevy
Chase</i>. Later poets naturally adapted the Ballad
form to their own uses, and so we have the artificial
Ballad, illustrated by Cowper's <i>The History of John</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
<i>Gilpin</i>, Longfellow's <i>The Wreck of the Hesperus</i>, and
Swinburne's <i>May Janet</i>. In these poems many of
the trite expressions so peculiar to the primitive Ballad
are retained; but, like the artificial Epic, the work is
no longer communal, but individual, in origin and bears
the stamp of one mind animated by an artistic purpose.</p>

<p>In discussing the Epic and the Ballad one is on fairly
safe ground, but between these types one finds a vast
amount of poetry, evidently narrative, which suggests
perplexing problems. Much of it may be made to come
under what we term loosely the <i>Metrical Romance</i>.
This title is often narrowed by scholars to apply strictly
to a poetical <i>genre</i>, arising in the Middle Ages and
brought into England by the Norman-French, which
deals in a rambling way with the marvellous adventures
of wandering knights or heroes. Its plot, in
which love and combat are conspicuous features, is
enveloped in a kind of glamour, an atmosphere of
unreality. It drew its material from many diverse
sources: from the legends of Troy and the stories of
classical and Oriental antiquity; from the tales of the
Frankish Emperor Charlemagne and his paladins;
from the Celtic accounts of King Arthur and the Table
Round. Since its characters, sometimes not without
anachronism, embodied the chivalric ideals of courtesy
and loyalty to ladies, hatred of paganism, and general
conduct according to a prescribed but unwritten code,
its appeal was made for the most part to the courtier
and the aristocrat,&mdash;though it must be added that many
of the robuster Charlemagne romances acquired currency
with the humbler classes and were sung in the
cottage of the peasant. The fact that the greater
number of these Metrical Romances were mere redactions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
taken from foreign models, makes them seem
deficient in English interest. Still, several of the best
were of native composition, an excellent example being
the well-known <i>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</i>.</p>

<p>But even in spite of a few slight advantages to be
gained, it seems unwise to restrict the Metrical Romance
too closely. What we are accustomed to call, rather
vaguely, romance is a persistent quality in narrative
poetry, and is not limited to the literature of any particular
age or rank of society. A cursory examination
will disclose many evidences of the romantic spirit in
both the Epic and the Ballad. And certainly Scott's
<i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, Keats's <i>The Eve of St.
Agnes</i>, Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i>, and many other poems
on similar themes must remain unclassified unless we
designate them broadly as Metrical Romances. Of
course, it is not essential that they should be pigeon-holed
and put away with the right label affixed. However,
one or two observations on the subject-matter with
which works of this nature deal may assist us in avoiding
embarrassing confusion. Sometimes the Metrical
Romance (using the term in its broader sense) deals
with authenticated incidents of history. In such cases,
the narrative, founded as it is on matters of fact, is
compelled to preserve substantial accuracy with regard
to the events which it uses for a structure. The fancy
is thus partly curbed through the necessity of not
departing radically from the truth. This restraint,
logically enough, does not prevent the introduction of
fictitious characters or episodes; but in the strict historical
poem, as in the historical novel, it does require
adherence to chronology and a just representation of
the period in which the action takes place. Occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
this form approaches a poetical paraphrase, as in
Rossetti's <i>The White Ship</i>. The nineteenth century
was singularly prolific in works of this sort; notable
among such works are Scott's <i>Marmion</i>, Tennyson's
<i>The Revenge</i>, and Longfellow's <i>Paul Revere's Ride</i>.
If the basis of the poem is mythological, we have a further
species of the Metrical Romance. The stories clustered
around the gods and goddesses of unsophisticated
peoples are perennially attractive and offer a
fruitful field to the poet. In the setting there is frequent
opportunity for elaborate description, and there
is often, as in Tennyson's <i>&OElig;none</i> and William Morris's
<i>Atalanta's Race</i>, ornamentation used by the author
that is more than ordinarily remarkable. For such
poetry the Greek and Latin writers furnish a wealth
of material for imitation. Nor have the myths of
other races been neglected in recent years. Matthew
Arnold's <i>Balder Dead</i> has its inspiration in the Norse
<i>Eddas</i> and has its opening scene in Valhalla where
Odin, father of the gods, presides over the immortals.
William Morris's <i>Sigurd the Volsing</i> is an adaptation
of the myths of the early Germans.</p>

<p>It is not aside from the point to refer here to the
few poems in which the subject-matter of the Metrical
Romance is used, strangely enough, as a means of
teaching moral ideas. Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i> presents
such an anomaly. In it conventional chivalric heroes
undergo surprising and impossible adventures, battling
and loving as in the legends of Charlemagne and
Arthur. Indeed, in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, Arthur himself
appears as the protagonist. But these knights and
ladies are, we learn, merely animated vices and virtues
and are such, because, as Spenser takes pains to tell us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
the poem, though romantic in mood, is allegorical in intention,
its aim being "to fashion a gentleman or noble
person in vertuous and gentle discipline."
The author in using his characters as agents of moral instruction
creates a type as much by itself as <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>
is in prose. Modern examples less conspicuous for
visible allegorical intention are Tennyson's <i>Idylls of
the King</i>, in which Arthurian material is once more
revived with something of an ethical purpose.</p>

<p>There is still to be taken up a large body of poems,
usually, though not always, shorter than the Metrical
Romances, which deal with the situations of common
life and with the humbler members of society. By
some authorities the term Metrical Tale has been applied
to such compositions; though it is hardly exact
or specific, since the word "tale" is usually made
synonymous with "story" and therefore does not
connote a limited subject-matter. We may accept it
in a provisional way as a convenient technical term
for our purposes. The Metrical Tale, then, as contrasted
with the Metrical Romance, attempts a realistic
portrayal of the natural sorrows, losses, or pains
which belong to our everyday experience. The
emotions of which it treats are fundamentally strong
and keep the style and versification from becoming
overelaborated. The Metrical Tale may be humorous
as in Chaucer's <i>The Miller's Tale</i>, or may be pathetic
and tragic as in Tennyson's <i>Enoch Arden</i> or Wordsworth's
<i>Michael</i>. In these poems it will be observed
that the diction and phraseology are exceedingly
simple. But here, too, candor requires the admission
that the alleged difference between the Romance and
the Tale is likely to bring on a charge of inconsistency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
<i>Enoch Arden</i>, just now mentioned, abounds in romantic
episodes, though Enoch and Philip and Annie dwell
in a little fishing village. Why, if Chaucer chose to
call his masterpiece the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, should any
one take the liberty of questioning his nomenclature?
The query is well founded; and yet the reader must
recognize a wide gulf in tone and spirit between <i>The
Knight's Tale</i> and <i>The Reeve's Tale</i>. Call it, if you
will, the distinction between idealism and realism;
at any rate it exists, and ought to be made plain even
at the risk of confronting dilemmas of another sort.</p>

<p>Having a kind of relationship to what we call arbitrarily
the Metrical Tale is the Beast Fable in verse,
in which animals and birds are endowed with reason
and speech. The excuse for the Beast Fable is an
ethical one, and the story, often humorous, is merely a
vehicle for instruction,&mdash;a fact evident enough from
the so-called moral appended to most Beast Fables.
The best Beast Fables in English are those of John
Gay.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this introduction to make
any but a passing reference to the forms of versification
which have been used in narrative poetry. In
general, the range of metres is wide and varied, though
a few common lines and stanzas occur with much
frequency. Blank Verse, a favorite Epic measure
used by Milton in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, has also been effective
in the Metrical Romance (Arnold's <i>Sohrab and Rustum</i>)
and the Metrical Tale (Wordsworth's <i>Michael</i>). It is
peculiarly fitting to longer poems of a serious character.
The Heroic Couplet, made up of two rimed iambic
pentameters, was invented by Chaucer and tried in
many of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. It has since become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
very common, being the measure of such widely different
poems as Marlowe's <i>Hero and Leander</i>, Pope's
<i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, and Keats's <i>Lamia</i>. Octosyllabic
verse is frequently found,&mdash;sometimes in rimed couplets
as in Scott's <i>Marmion</i>, less often unrimed as in
Longfellow's <i>Hiawatha</i>. In the couplet form it is
especially suited to war poetry where a rapid movement
is desirable. The standard four-lined ballad
stanza with rimed alternate lines has continued in
popularity with the artificial ballad writers and has
been used in such poems as Wordsworth's <i>Lucy Gray</i>
and Longfellow's <i>The Wreck of the Hesperus</i>. Most
complicated of all the narrative stanzaic forms is the
Spenserian stanza, devised by Spenser for his <i>Faerie
Queene</i> and imitated by Keats in <i>The Eve of St.
Agnes</i>. It has a stateliness which makes it well adapted
to dignified themes. In some few examples there is a
metre wholly irregular and following the movement of
the story, as in Tennyson's <i>The Revenge</i> and Browning's
<i>HervÃ© Riel</i>.</p>

<p>The discussion of narrative methods may be left to
the will and discretion of the teacher. A study of the
separate poems here presented will show that while
the four almost indispensable elements of narration&mdash;plot,
setting, characters, and motive&mdash;may usually
be found, their use and emphasis vary greatly according
to the theories and personalities of the authors.
The employment of such arts of construction as suspense
and climax may be discovered by the individual
student, who should also test each poem for its unity,
coherence, and proportion. In a collection such as this
there is ample room for instructive criticism and comparison.
But narrative poems may well be read for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
the interest they excite. If a narrative poem fails in
this respect, it is all but condemned from the start.
It is hoped that these examples may show the student
that <i>poetry</i> is not always dull and lifeless; that it may
possess at times all the features which make literature
attractive as well as inspiring.</p>

<span class="i0">Careless of books, yet having felt the power</span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature, by the gentle agency</span>
<span class="i0">Of natural objects, led me on to feel<span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">For passions that were not my own, and think</span>
<span class="i0">(At random and imperfectly indeed)</span>
<span class="i0">On man, the heart of man, and human life.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, although it be a history</span>
<span class="i0">Homely and rude, I will relate the same<span class="linenum">35</span></span>
<span class="i0">For the delight of a few natural hearts;</span>
<span class="i0">And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake</span>
<span class="i0">Of youthful Poets, who among these hills</span>
<span class="i0">Will be my second self when I am gone.</span>
<span class="i2">Upon the forest side in Grasmere vale<span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt a shepherd, Michael was his name;</span>
<span class="i0">An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.</span>
<span class="i0">His bodily frame had been from youth to age</span>
<span class="i0">Of an unusual strength; his mind was keen,</span>
<span class="i0">Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,<span class="linenum">45</span></span>
<span class="i0">And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt</span>
<span class="i0">And watchful more than ordinary men.</span>
<span class="i0">Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,</span>
<span class="i0">Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes,</span>
<span class="i0">When others heeded not, he heard the South<span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">Make subterraneous music, like the noise</span>
<span class="i0">Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.</span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd, at such warning, of his flock</span>
<span class="i0">Bethought him, and he to himself would say,</span>
<span class="i0">"The winds are now devising work for me!"<span class="linenum">55</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives</span>
<span class="i0">The traveller to a shelter, summoned him</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the mountains: he had been alone</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the heart of many thousand mists,</span>
<span class="i0">That came to him, and left him, on the heights.<span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">So lived he till his eightieth year was past.</span>
<span class="i0">And grossly that man errs who should suppose</span>
<span class="i0">That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,</span>
<span class="i0">Were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts.</span>
<span class="i0">Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed<span class="linenum">65</span></span>
<span class="i0">The common air; hills which with vigorous step</span>
<span class="i0">He had so often climbed; which had impressed</span>
<span class="i0">So many incidents upon his mind</span>
<span class="i0">Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;</span>
<span class="i0">Which, like a book, preserved the memory<span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,</span>
<span class="i0">Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts</span>
<span class="i0">The certainty of honorable gain;</span>
<span class="i0">Those fields, those hills&mdash;what could they less? had laid</span>
<span class="i0">Strong hold on his affections, were to him<span class="linenum">75</span></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasurable feeling of blind love,</span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure which there is in life itself.</span>
<span class="i2">His days had not been passed in singleness.</span>
<span class="i0">His Helpmate was a comely matron, old&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Though younger than himself full twenty years.<span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">She was a woman of a stirring life,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had</span>
<span class="i0">Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;</span>
<span class="i0">That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest</span>
<span class="i0">It was because the other was at work.<span class="linenum">85</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Pair had but one inmate in their house,</span>
<span class="i0">An only Child, who had been born to them</span>
<span class="i0">When Michael, telling o'er his years, began</span>
<span class="i0">To deem that he was old,&mdash;in shepherd's phrase,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With one foot in the grave. This only Son,<span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,</span>
<span class="i0">The one of an inestimable worth,</span>
<span class="i0">Made all their household. I may truly say,</span>
<span class="i0">That they were as a proverb in the vale</span>
<span class="i0">For endless industry. When day was gone,<span class="linenum">95</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from their occupations out of doors</span>
<span class="i0">The Son and Father were come home, even then,</span>
<span class="i0">Their labor did not cease; unless when all</span>
<span class="i0">Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there,</span>
<span class="i0">Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,<span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,</span>
<span class="i0">And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the meal</span>
<span class="i0">Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)</span>
<span class="i0">And his old Father both betook themselves</span>
<span class="i0">To such convenient work as might employ<span class="linenum">105</span></span>
<span class="i0">Their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card</span>
<span class="i0">Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair</span>
<span class="i0">Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,</span>
<span class="i0">Or other implement of house or field.</span>
<span class="i2">Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,<span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">That in our ancient uncouth country style</span>
<span class="i0">With huge and black projection overbrowed</span>
<span class="i0">Large space beneath, as duly as the light</span>
<span class="i0">Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp;</span>
<span class="i0">An aged utensil, which had performed<span class="linenum">115</span></span>
<span class="i0">Service beyond all others of its kind.</span>
<span class="i0">Early at evening did it burn&mdash;and late,</span>
<span class="i0">Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, going by from year to year, had found,</span>
<span class="i0">And left, the couple neither gay perhaps<span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,</span>
<span class="i0">Living a life of eager industry.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,</span>
<span class="i0">There by the light of this old lamp they sate,</span>
<span class="i0">Father and Son, while far into the night<span class="linenum">125</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,</span>
<span class="i0">Making the cottage through the silent hours</span>
<span class="i0">Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.</span>
<span class="i0">This light was famous in its neighborhood,</span>
<span class="i0">And was a public symbol of the life<span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,</span>
<span class="i0">Their cottage on a plot of rising ground</span>
<span class="i0">Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,</span>
<span class="i0">High into Easedale,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"
 class="fnanchor">[103]</a> up to Dunmail-Raise,</span>
<span class="i0">And westward to the village near the lake;<span class="linenum">135</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from this constant light, so regular</span>
<span class="i0">And so far seen, the House itself, by all</span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,</span>
<span class="i0">Both old and young, was named <span class="smcap">The Evening Star</span>.</span>
<span class="i2">Thus living on through such a length of years,<span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs</span>
<span class="i0">Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart</span>
<span class="i0">This son of his old age was yet more dear&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Less from instinctive tenderness, the same</span>
<span class="i0">Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all&mdash;<span class="linenum">145</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than that a child, more than all other gifts</span>
<span class="i0">That earth can offer to declining man,</span>
<span class="i0">Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,</span>
<span class="i0">And stirrings of inquietude, when they</span>
<span class="i0">By tendency of nature need must fail.<span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeding was the love he bare to him,</span>
<span class="i0">His heart and his heart's joy! For oftentimes</span>
<span class="i0">Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,</span>
<span class="i0">Had done him female service, not alone</span>
<span class="i0">For pastime and delight, as is the use<span class="linenum">155</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced</span>
<span class="i0">To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked</span>
<span class="i0">His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand.</span>
<span class="i2">And, in a later time, ere yet the boy</span>
<span class="i0">Had put on man's attire, did Michael love,<span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit of a stern unbending mind,</span>
<span class="i0">To have the Young-one in his sight, when he</span>
<span class="i0">Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool</span>
<span class="i0">Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched</span>
<span class="i0">Under the large old oak, that near his door<span class="linenum">165</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stood single, and from matchless depth of shade,</span>
<span class="i0">Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">Thence in our rustic dialect was called</span>
<span class="i0">The Clipping Tree, a name which yet it bears.</span>
<span class="i0">There while they two were sitting in the shade,<span class="linenum">170</span></span>
<span class="i0">With others round them, earnest all and blithe</span>
<span class="i0">Would Michael exercise his heart with looks</span>
<span class="i0">Of fond correction, and reproof bestowed</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the child, if he disturbed the sheep</span>
<span class="i0">By catching at their legs, or with his shouts<span class="linenum">175</span></span>
<span class="i0">Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.</span>
<span class="i2">And when by Heaven's good grace the boy grew up</span>
<span class="i0">A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek</span>
<span class="i0">Two steady roses that were five years old;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Michael from a winter coppice cut<span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped</span>
<span class="i0">With iron, making it throughout in all</span>
<span class="i0">Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,</span>
<span class="i0">And gave it to the boy; wherewith equipt</span>
<span class="i0">He as a watchman oftentimes was placed<span class="linenum">185</span></span>
<span class="i0">At gate or gap to stem or turn the flock;</span>
<span class="i0">And, to his office prematurely called,</span>
<span class="i0">There stood the urchin, as you will divine,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Something between a hindrance and a help;</span>
<span class="i0">And for this cause not always, I believe,<span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving from his father hire of praise;</span>
<span class="i0">Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,</span>
<span class="i0">Or looks or threatening gestures, could perform.</span>
<span class="i2">But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand</span>
<span class="i0">Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,<span class="linenum">195</span></span>
<span class="i0">Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,</span>
<span class="i0">He with his father daily went, and they</span>
<span class="i0">Were as companions, why should I relate</span>
<span class="i0">That objects which the shepherd loved before</span>
<span class="i0">Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came<span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Feelings and emanations&mdash;things which were</span>
<span class="i0">Light to the sun and music to the wind;</span>
<span class="i0">And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?</span>
<span class="i2">Thus in his father's sight the Boy grew up;</span>
<span class="i0">And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,<span class="linenum">205</span></span>
<span class="i0">He was his comfort and his daily hope.</span>
<span class="i2">While in this sort the simple household lived</span>
<span class="i0">From day to day, to Michael's ear there came</span>
<span class="i0">Distressful tidings. Long before the time</span>
<span class="i0">Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound<span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">In surety for his brother's son, a man</span>
<span class="i0">Of an industrious life, and ample means;</span>
<span class="i0">But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly</span>
<span class="i0">Had prest upon him; and old Michael now</span>
<span class="i0">Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,<span class="linenum">215</span></span>
<span class="i0">A grievous penalty, but little less</span>
<span class="i0">Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,</span>
<span class="i0">At the first hearing, for a moment took</span>
<span class="i0">More hope out of his life than he supposed</span>
<span class="i0">That any old man ever could have lost.<span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as he had armed himself with strength</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To look his troubles in the face, it seemed</span>
<span class="i0">The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once</span>
<span class="i0">A portion of his patrimonial fields.</span>
<span class="i0">Such was his first resolve; he thought again,<span class="linenum">225</span></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart failed him. "Isabel," said he,</span>
<span class="i0">Two evenings after he had heard the news,</span>
<span class="i0">"I have been toiling more than seventy years,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the open sunshine of God's love</span>
<span class="i0">Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours<span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think</span>
<span class="i0">That I could not lie quiet in my grave.</span>
<span class="i0">Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself</span>
<span class="i0">Has scarcely been more diligent than I;</span>
<span class="i0">And I have lived to be a fool at last<span class="linenum">235</span></span>
<span class="i0">To my own family. An evil man</span>
<span class="i0">That was, and made an evil choice, if he</span>
<span class="i0">Were false to us; and if he were not false,</span>
<span class="i0">There are ten thousand to whom loss like this</span>
<span class="i0">Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;&mdash;but<span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.</span>
<span class="i2">When I began, my purpose was to speak</span>
<span class="i0">Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.</span>
<span class="i0">Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land</span>
<span class="i0">Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;<span class="linenum">245</span></span>
<span class="i0">He shall possess it, free as is the wind</span>
<span class="i0">That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,</span>
<span class="i0">Another kinsman&mdash;he will be our friend</span>
<span class="i0">In this distress. He is a prosperous man,</span>
<span class="i0">Thriving in trade&mdash;and Luke to him shall go,<span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift</span>
<span class="i0">He quickly will repair this loss, and then</span>
<span class="i0">He may return to us. If here he stay,</span>
<span class="i0">What can be done? Where every one is poor,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What can be gained?"</span>
<span class="i21">At this the old Man paused,<span class="linenum">255</span></span>
<span class="i0">And Isabel sat silent, for her mind</span>
<span class="i0">Was busy, looking back into past times.</span>
<span class="i0">There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,</span>
<span class="i0">He was a parish-boy&mdash;at the church-door</span>
<span class="i0">They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence<span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbors bought</span>
<span class="i0">A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;</span>
<span class="i0">And, with this basket on his arm, the lad</span>
<span class="i0">Went up to London, found a master there,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy<span class="linenum">265</span></span>
<span class="i0">To go and overlook his merchandise</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,</span>
<span class="i0">And left estates and monies to the poor,</span>
<span class="i0">And, at his birthplace, built a chapel, floored</span>
<span class="i0">With marble which he sent from foreign lands.<span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">These thoughts, and many others of like sort,</span>
<span class="i0">Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,</span>
<span class="i0">And her face brightened. The old Man was glad,</span>
<span class="i0">And thus resumed:&mdash;"Well, Isabel! this scheme</span>
<span class="i0">These two days, has been meat and drink to me.<span class="linenum">275</span></span>
<span class="i0">Far more than we have lost is left us yet.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;We have enough&mdash;I wish indeed that I</span>
<span class="i0">Were younger;&mdash;but this hope is a good hope.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best</span>
<span class="i0">Buy for him more, and let us send him forth<span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;If he <i>could</i> go, the Boy should go to-night."</span>
<span class="i2">Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth</span>
<span class="i0">With a light heart. The Housewife for five days</span>
<span class="i0">Was restless morn and night, and all day long<span class="linenum">285</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Things needful for the journey of her son.</span>
<span class="i0">But Isabel was glad when Sunday came</span>
<span class="i0">To stop her in her work: for, when she lay</span>
<span class="i0">By Michael's side, she through the last two nights<span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep;</span>
<span class="i0">And when they rose at morning she could see</span>
<span class="i0">That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon</span>
<span class="i0">She said to Luke, while they two by themselves</span>
<span class="i0">Were sitting at the door, "Thou must not go:<span class="linenum">295</span></span>
<span class="i0">We have no other Child but thee to lose,</span>
<span class="i0">None to remember&mdash;do not go away,</span>
<span class="i0">For if thou leave thy Father, he will die."</span>
<span class="i0">The Youth made answer with a jocund voice;</span>
<span class="i0">And Isabel, when she had told her fears,<span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">Recovered heart. That evening her best fare</span>
<span class="i0">Did she bring forth, and all together sat</span>
<span class="i0">Like happy people round a Christmas fire.</span>
<span class="i2">With daylight Isabel resumed her work;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the ensuing week the house appeared<span class="linenum">305</span></span>
<span class="i0">As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length</span>
<span class="i0">The expected letter from their kinsman came,</span>
<span class="i0">With kind assurances that he would do</span>
<span class="i0">His utmost for the welfare of the boy;</span>
<span class="i0">To which, requests were added, that forthwith<span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">He might be sent to him. Ten times or more</span>
<span class="i0">The letter was read over; Isabel</span>
<span class="i0">Went forth to show it to the neighbors round;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor was there at that time on English land</span>
<span class="i0">A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel<span class="linenum">315</span></span>
<span class="i0">Had to her house returned, the old Man said,</span>
<span class="i0">"He shall depart to-morrow." To this word</span>
<span class="i0">The Housewife answered, talking much of things</span>
<span class="i0">Which, if at such short notice he should go,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Would surely be forgotten. But at length<span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.</span>
<span class="i2">Near the tumultuous brook of Greenhead Ghyll,</span>
<span class="i0">In that deep valley, Michael had designed</span>
<span class="i0">To build a Sheepfold; and, before he heard</span>
<span class="i0">The tidings of his melancholy loss,<span class="linenum">325</span></span>
<span class="i0">For this same purpose he had gathered up</span>
<span class="i0">A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge</span>
<span class="i0">Lay thrown together, ready for the work.</span>
<span class="i0">With Luke that evening thitherward he walked:</span>
<span class="i0">And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,<span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the old man spoke to him:&mdash;"My son,</span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart</span>
<span class="i0">I look upon thee, for thou art the same</span>
<span class="i0">That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,</span>
<span class="i0">And all thy life hast been my daily joy.<span class="linenum">335</span></span>
<span class="i0">I will relate to thee some little part</span>
<span class="i0">Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good</span>
<span class="i0">When thou art from me, even if I should touch</span>
<span class="i0">On things thou canst not know of.&mdash;After thou</span>
<span class="i0">First cam'st into the world&mdash;as oft befalls<span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">To new-born infants&mdash;thou didst sleep away</span>
<span class="i0">Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue</span>
<span class="i0">Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,</span>
<span class="i0">And still I loved thee with increasing love.</span>
<span class="i0">Never to living ear came sweeter sounds<span class="linenum">345</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then when I heard thee by our own fireside</span>
<span class="i0">First uttering, without words, a natural tune;</span>
<span class="i0">While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy</span>
<span class="i0">Sing at thy mother's breast. Month followed month</span>
<span class="i0">And in the open fields my life was passed<span class="linenum">350</span></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,</span>
<span class="i0">As well thou knowest, in us the old and young</span>
<span class="i0">Have played together, nor with me didst thou<span class="linenum">355</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."</span>
<span class="i0">Luke had a manly heart; but at these words</span>
<span class="i0">He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Nay, do not take it so&mdash;I see</span>
<span class="i0">That these are things of which I need not speak.<span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Even to the utmost I have been to thee</span>
<span class="i0">A kind and a good Father: and herein</span>
<span class="i0">I but repay a gift which I myself</span>
<span class="i0">Received at others' hands; for, though now old</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the common life of man, I still<span class="linenum">365</span></span>
<span class="i0">Remember them who loved me in my youth.</span>
<span class="i0">Both of them sleep together: here they lived,</span>
<span class="i0">As all their Forefathers had done; and when</span>
<span class="i0">At length their time was come, they were not loth</span>
<span class="i0">To give their bodies to the family mould.<span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived:</span>
<span class="i0">But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,</span>
<span class="i0">And see so little gain from threescore years.</span>
<span class="i0">These fields were burthened when they came to me;</span>
<span class="i0">Till I was forty years of age, not more<span class="linenum">375</span></span>
<span class="i0">Than half of my inheritance was mine.</span>
<span class="i0">I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,</span>
<span class="i0">And till these three weeks past the land was free.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;It looks as if it never could endure</span>
<span class="i0">Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,<span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good</span>
<span class="i0">That thou should'st go."</span>
<span class="i25">At this the old Man paused;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"This was a work for us; and now, my Son,<span class="linenum">385</span></span>
<span class="i0">It is a work for me. But, lay one stone&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, Boy, be of good hope;&mdash;we both may live</span>
<span class="i0">To see a better day. At eighty-four</span>
<span class="i0">I still am strong and hale;&mdash;do thou thy part;<span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0">I will do mine.&mdash;I will begin again</span>
<span class="i0">With many tasks that were resigned to thee:</span>
<span class="i0">Up to the heights, and in among the storms,</span>
<span class="i0">Will I without thee go again, and do</span>
<span class="i0">All works which I was wont to do alone,<span class="linenum">395</span></span>
<span class="i0">Before I knew thy face.&mdash;Heaven bless thee, Boy!</span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast</span>
<span class="i0">With many hopes; it should be so&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I knew that thou could'st never have a wish</span>
<span class="i0">To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me<span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Only by links of love: when thou art gone,</span>
<span class="i0">What will be left to us!&mdash;But, I forget</span>
<span class="i0">My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,</span>
<span class="i0">As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,</span>
<span class="i0">When thou art gone away, should evil men<span class="linenum">405</span></span>
<span class="i0">Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,</span>
<span class="i0">And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,</span>
<span class="i0">And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear</span>
<span class="i0">And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou</span>
<span class="i0">May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived,<span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who, being innocent, did for that cause</span>
<span class="i0">Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see</span>
<span class="i0">A work which is not here: a covenant</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,</span>
<span class="i0">And, as his Father had requested, laid</span>
<span class="i0">The first stone of the Sheepfold. At the sight<span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart</span>
<span class="i0">He pressed his Son, he kissed him and wept;</span>
<span class="i0">And to the house together they returned.</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere the night fell:&mdash;with morrow's dawn the Boy<span class="linenum">425</span></span>
<span class="i0">Began his journey, and when he had reached</span>
<span class="i0">The public way, he put on a bold face;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the neighbors, as he passed their doors,</span>
<span class="i0">Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,</span>
<span class="i0">That followed him till he was out of sight.<span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i2">A good report did from their Kinsman come,</span>

<span class="i0">"The prettiest letters that were ever seen."<span class="linenum">435</span></span>
<span class="i0">Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.</span>
<span class="i0">So, many months passed on: and once again</span>
<span class="i0">The Shepherd went about his daily work</span>
<span class="i0">With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour<span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">He to that valley took his way, and there</span>
<span class="i0">Wrought at the Sheepfold. Meantime Luke began</span>
<span class="i0">To slacken in his duty; and, at length,</span>
<span class="i0">He in the dissolute city gave himself</span>
<span class="i0">To evil courses: ignominy and shame<span class="linenum">445</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on him, so that he was driven at last</span>

<span class="i0">I have conversed with more than one who well</span>
<span class="i0">Remember the old Man, and what he was</span>
<span class="i0">Years after he had heard this heavy news.</span>
<span class="i0">His bodily frame had been from youth to age</span>
<span class="i0">Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks<span class="linenum">455</span></span>
<span class="i0">He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,</span>
<span class="i0">And listened to the wind; and, as before,</span>
<span class="i0">Performed all kinds of labor for his sheep,</span>
<span class="i0">And for the land, his small inheritance.</span>
<span class="i0">And to that hollow dell from time to time<span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Did he repair, to build the Fold of which</span>
<span class="i0">His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet</span>
<span class="i0">The pity which was then in every heart</span>
<span class="i0">For the old Man&mdash;and 'tis believed by all</span>
<span class="i0">That many and many a day he thither went,<span class="linenum">465</span></span>
<span class="i0">And never lifted up a single stone.</span>
<span class="i2">There, by the Sheepfold, sometimes was he seen</span>
<span class="i0">Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog,</span>
<span class="i0">Then old, beside him, lying at his feet.</span>
<span class="i0">The length of full seven years, from time to time,<span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">He at the building of this Sheepfold wrought,</span>
<span class="i0">And left the work unfinished when he died.</span>
<span class="i0">Three years, or little more, did Isabel</span>
<span class="i0">Survive her Husband: at his death the estate</span>

<h3>DORA</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With farmer Allan at the farm abode</span>
<span class="i0">William and Dora. William was his son,</span>
<span class="i0">And she his niece. He often looked at them,</span>
<span class="i0">And often thought, "I'll make them man and wife."</span>
<span class="i0">Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,<span class="linenum">5</span></span>
<span class="i0">And yearn'd towards William; but the youth, because</span>
<span class="i0">He had been always with her in the house,</span>
<span class="i0">Thought not of Dora.</span>
<span class="i24">Then there came a day</span>
<span class="i0">When Allan call'd his son, and said, "My son:</span>
<span class="i0">I married late, but I would wish to see<span class="linenum">10</span></span>
<span class="i0">My grandchild on my knees before I die:</span>
<span class="i0">And I have set my heart upon a match.</span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore look to Dora; she is well</span>
<span class="i0">To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.</span>
<span class="i0">She is my brother's daughter: he and I<span class="linenum">15</span></span>
<span class="i0">Had once hard words, and parted, and he died</span>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred</span>
<span class="i0">His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;</span>
<span class="i0">For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,</span>
<span class="i0">For many years." But William answer'd short:<span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">"I cannot marry Dora; by my life,</span>
<span class="i0">I will not marry Dora." Then the old man</span>
<span class="i0">Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:</span>
<span class="i0">"You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!</span>
<span class="i0">But in my time a father's word was law,<span class="linenum">25</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;</span>
<span class="i0">Consider, William: take a month to think,</span>
<span class="i0">And let me have an answer to my wish;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,</span>
<span class="i0">And never more darken my doors again."<span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,</span>
<span class="i0">And broke away. The more he look'd at her</span>
<span class="i0">The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;</span>
<span class="i0">But Dora bore them meekly. Then before</span>
<span class="i0">The month was out he left his father's house,<span class="linenum">35</span></span>
<span class="i0">And hired himself to work within the fields;</span>
<span class="i0">And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed</span>
<span class="i0">A laborer's daughter, Mary Morrison.</span>
<span class="i2">Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd</span>
<span class="i0">His niece and said: "My girl, I love you well;<span class="linenum">40</span></span>
<span class="i0">But if you speak with him that was my son,</span>
<span class="i0">Or change a word with her he calls his wife,</span>
<span class="i0">My home is none of yours. My will is law."</span>
<span class="i0">And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,</span>
<span class="i0">"It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!"<span class="linenum">45</span></span>
<span class="i2">And days went on, and there was born a boy</span>
<span class="i0">To William; then distresses came on him;</span>
<span class="i0">And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,</span>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken, and his father help'd him not.</span>
<span class="i0">But Dora stored what little she could save,<span class="linenum">50</span></span>
<span class="i0">And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know</span>
<span class="i0">Who sent it; till at last a fever seized</span>
<span class="i0">On William, and in harvest time he died.</span>
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat</span>
<span class="i0">And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought<span class="linenum">55</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:</span>
<span class="i2">"I have obey'd my uncle until now,</span>
<span class="i0">And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This evil came on William at the first.</span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,<span class="linenum">60</span></span>
<span class="i0">And for your sake, the woman that he chose,</span>
<span class="i0">And for this orphan, I am come to you:</span>
<span class="i0">You know there has not been for these five years</span>
<span class="i0">So full a harvest: let me take the boy,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will set him in my uncle's eye<span class="linenum">65</span></span>
<span class="i0">Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad</span>
<span class="i0">Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,</span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."</span>
<span class="i2">And Dora took the child, and went her way</span>
<span class="i0">Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound<span class="linenum">70</span></span>
<span class="i0">That was unsown, where many poppies grew.</span>
<span class="i0">Far off the farmer came into the field</span>
<span class="i0">And spied her not; for none of all his men</span>
<span class="i0">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;</span>
<span class="i0">And Dora would have risen and gone to him,<span class="linenum">75</span></span>
<span class="i0">But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.</span>
<span class="i2">But when the morrow came, she rose and took</span>
<span class="i0">The child once more, and sat upon the mound;</span>
<span class="i0">And made a little wreath of all the flowers<span class="linenum">80</span></span>
<span class="i0">That grew about, and tied it round his hat</span>
<span class="i0">To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.</span>
<span class="i0">Then when the farmer pass'd into the field</span>
<span class="i0">He spied her, and he left his men at work,</span>
<span class="i0">And came and said: "Where were you yesterday?<span class="linenum">85</span></span>
<span class="i0">Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"</span>
<span class="i0">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And answer'd softly, "This is William's child!"</span>
<span class="i0">"And did I not," said Allan, "did I not</span>
<span class="i0">Forbid you, Dora?" Dora said again:<span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">"Do with me as you will, but take the child,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"</span>
<span class="i0">And Allan said, "I see it is a trick</span>
<span class="i0">Got up betwixt you and the woman there.</span>
<span class="i0">I must be taught my duty, and by you!<span class="linenum">95</span></span>
<span class="i0">You knew my word was law, and yet you dared</span>
<span class="i0">To slight it. Well&mdash;for I will take the boy;</span>
<span class="i0">But go you hence, and never see me more."</span>
<span class="i2">So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud</span>
<span class="i0">And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell<span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0">At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,</span>
<span class="i0">And the boy's cry came to her from the field,</span>
<span class="i0">More and more distant. She bow'd down her head,</span>
<span class="i0">Remembering the day when first she came,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the things that had been. She bow'd down<span class="linenum">105</span></span>
<span class="i0">And wept in secret; and the reapers reap'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.</span>
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy</span>
<span class="i0">Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise<span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">To God, that help'd her in her widowhood.</span>
<span class="i0">And Dora said, "My uncle took the boy;</span>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, let me live and work with you:</span>
<span class="i0">He says that he will never see me more."</span>
<span class="i0">Then answer'd Mary, "This shall never be,<span class="linenum">115</span></span>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:</span>
<span class="i0">And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,</span>
<span class="i0">For he will teach him hardness, and to slight</span>
<span class="i0">His mother; therefore thou and I will go,</span>
<span class="i0">And I will have my boy, and bring him home;<span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">And I will beg of him to take thee back:</span>
<span class="i0">But if he will not take thee back again,</span>
<span class="i0">Then thou and I will live within one house,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And work for William's child, until he grows</span>
<span class="i0">Of age to help us."</span>
<span class="i22">So the women kiss'd<span class="linenum">125</span></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.</span>
<span class="i0">The door was off the latch: they peep'd, and saw</span>
<span class="i0">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,</span>
<span class="i0">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,</span>
<span class="i0">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,<span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that loved him: and the lad stretch'd out</span>
<span class="i0">And babbled for the golden seal, that hung</span>
<span class="i0">From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.</span>
<span class="i0">Then they came in: but when the boy beheld</span>
<span class="i0">His mother, he cried out to come to her:<span class="linenum">135</span></span>
<span class="i0">And Allan set him down, and Mary said:</span>
<span class="i2">"O Father!&mdash;if you let me call you so&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I never came a-begging for myself,</span>
<span class="i0">Or William, or this child; but now I come</span>
<span class="i0">For Dora: take her back; she loves you well.<span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">O Sir, when William died, he died at peace</span>
<span class="i0">With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said,</span>
<span class="i0">He could not ever rue his marrying me&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I had been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said</span>
<span class="i0">That he was wrong to cross his father thus:<span class="linenum">145</span></span>
<span class="i0">'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know</span>
<span class="i0">The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turn'd</span>
<span class="i0">His face and pass'd&mdash;unhappy that I am!</span>
<span class="i0">But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you</span>
<span class="i0">Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight<span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">His father's memory; and take Dora back,</span>
<span class="i0">And let all this be as it was before."</span>
<span class="i2">So Mary said, and Dora hid her face</span>
<span class="i0">By Mary. There was silence in the room;</span>
<span class="i0">And all at once the old man burst in sobs:&mdash;<span class="linenum">155</span></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"I have been to blame&mdash;to blame. I have kill'd my son.</span>
<span class="i0">I have kill'd him&mdash;but I loved him&mdash;my dear son.</span>
<span class="i0">May God forgive me!&mdash;I have been to blame.</span>
<span class="i0">Kiss me, my children."</span>
<span class="i24">Then they clung about</span>
<span class="i0">The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times<span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">And all the man was broken with remorse;</span>
<span class="i0">And all his love came back a hundredfold;</span>
<span class="i0">And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child,</span>
<span class="i0">Thinking of William.</span>
<span class="i22">So those four abode</span>
<span class="i0">Within one house together; and as years<span class="linenum">165</span></span>
<span class="i0">Went forward, Mary took another mate;</span>
<span class="i0">But Dora lived unmarried till her death.</span>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Atalanta</span>, daughter of King Sch&oelig;neus,
not willing to lose her virgin's estate, made it a law to all suitors that they should run
a race with her in the public place, and if they failed to overcome her should die
unrevenged; and thus many brave men perished. At last came Milanion, the son of Amphidamas,
who, outrunning her with the help of Venus, gained the virgin and wedded her.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_COWPER" id="WILLIAM_COWPER">WILLIAM COWPER</a></h2>

<p class="indent">William Cowper was born at Great Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire,
England, in 1731. He was educated first at a private
school and afterwards at Westminster in London. He studied
law, but his progress in the profession was blocked because of
an attack of insanity brought on in 1763 by nervousness over
an oral examination for a clerkship in the House of Commons.
After fifteen months he recovered and went to live at Huntingdon,
where he met the Unwin family and began what was to
be a lifelong friendship with Mrs. Unwin. Upon Mr. Unwin's
death in 1767, Cowper moved with Mrs. Unwin to Olney, passing
a secluded life there until 1786. In 1773 he suffered a
second attack of melancholia, which lasted sixteen months.
Soon after his recovery he coÃ¶perated with the Rev. John
Newton in writing the well-known <i>Olney Hymns</i> (1779). In
1782 he published his first volume of poems, and a second volume
followed in 1785, containing <i>The Task</i>, <i>Tirocinium</i>, and the
ballad of <i>John Gilpin</i>. A translation of Homer was completed
in 1791. After 1791 his reason became hopelessly deranged,
and he passed the time until his death in 1800 in utter misery.</p>

<p class="indent">Cowper was a man of kind and gentle character, a lover of
nature in her milder aspects, and especially fond of animals.
As one of the forerunners of the so-called Romantic movement
in English poetry, his name is significant. Though at his
best in work of a descriptive or satiric kind, he was also gifted
with a subtle humor which appears frequently in many short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
tales and ballads. A good biography of Cowper is that by
Goldwin Smith in the English Men of Letters Series.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Diverting History of John Gilpin</span>
<a href="#Page_1">(Page 1)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">The story of John Gilpin was told to Cowper by his friend,
Lady Austen, who had heard it when a child. The poet, upon
whom the tale made a deep impression, eventually turned it
into this ballad, which was first published anonymously in the
<i>Public Advertiser</i> for November 14, 1782. It became popular
at once, and is to-day probably the most widely known of the
author's works. It is written in the conventional ballad metre,
and preserves many expressions characteristic of the primitive
English ballad style.</p>

<h2><a name="ROBERT_BURNS" id="ROBERT_BURNS">ROBERT BURNS</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Robert Burns was born of peasant parentage near Ayr,
Scotland, on January 25, 1759. Up to the time when he was
twenty-five years old he lived and worked on his father's
farm, except for two short absences in near-by towns. While
he was very young, he formed bad habits, from which he could
never free himself, and which eventually wrecked his career.
He was frequently in love, and many of the resulting entanglements
brought him little but sorrow. In 1786, as a result of
an unfortunate affair with Jean Armour, he determined to sail
for America, and in order to raise the necessary money, published
a volume of poems for which he was paid twenty pounds.
The book was received with enthusiasm and so elated Burns
with his success, that he decided to remain in Scotland. He
accepted an invitation to Edinburgh, where he was entertained
royally by literary circles. However, he was compelled to
return to farming, and after marrying Jean Armour took a
tenancy at Ellisland in 1788. A little later he was appointed
exciseman, but his convivial tendencies were undermining his
health, and he found his duties hard to attend to. He moved
to Dumfries, where he died in poverty in 1796.</p>

<p class="indent">Burns as a writer of songs, especially of love lyrics, is unsurpassed.
He touched the depths of human passion as few have
ever done, and has made his poetry live in the hearts of the
people. He is also the poet of Scottish peasant life, the enemy
of oppression and tyranny, and the supporter of patriotism.
Failure though he was from a worldly point of view, he was
more unfortunate than culpable, and deserves our pity rather
than our censure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Carlyle's <i>Essay on Burns</i> gives an excellent idea of the character
and work of the poet.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tam O'Shanter</span>
<a href="#Page_11">(Page 11)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Written in 1790 in a single day and first published in 1791
as a contribution to Grose's <i>Antiquities of Scotland</i>, it has
been called "a masterpiece of Scottish character, Scottish
humor, Scottish witch-lore, and Scottish imagination." Burns
himself considered it to be his finest poem.</p>

<h2><a name="WALTER_SCOTT" id="WALTER_SCOTT">WALTER SCOTT</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1771,
of an old Border family. Up to the age of four he was rather
feeble, an attack of fever having left him with a shrunken
right leg. This disability, though it did not prevent his becoming
a strong, sturdy man, still gave him ample leisure for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
wide reading while he was young. In high school and at the
University of Edinburgh he was not known as a scholar, though
he was popular with his companions, especially as a storyteller.
In obedience to his father's wishes he took up law
and toiled unenthusiastically at this profession for some years.
Some trips of his into the Scotch Highlands led him to make
a collection of old ballads, published in <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>
(1802). From this time on he devoted himself exclusively to
literature. His first important original poem, <i>The Lay of the
Last Minstrel</i>, came out in 1805, followed by <i>Marmion</i> (1808),
<i>The Lady of the Lake</i> (1810), <i>The Vision of Don Roderick</i>
(1811), and others of less merit. He had about this time become
a silent partner in the printing firm of Ballantyne Brothers,
contributing largely to the capital. In 1812 he purchased a
farm on the river Tweed and built the famous house Abbotsford.
The estate was an unprofitable investment, as it led
him into extravagances apparently justified by an increasing
income but really based on a false optimism.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1814 Scott wrote <i>Waverley</i>, the first of the long series of
novels which made him distinguished as a prose-writer. From
this time on his major work was in prose. He recognized
without envy that Byron was beating him on his own ground
in poetry, and accordingly changed to a field where success
was surer. He was apparently prospering financially when, in
1827, the firm of which he was a member went into bankruptcy,
largely because of poor business management, and he was left
shouldered with a debt of about $600,000. Undaunted he set
to work at the age of fifty-five to satisfy his creditors, and
book after book poured from his pen until in four years he had
paid off $270,000. The effort, however, was too much for his
health; he broke down, and, after a short visit to Italy, died
at Abbotsford in 1832.</p>

<p class="indent">Scott's character was almost wholly admirable. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
manly, courageous, faithful, and generous. Always popular,
he was a lavish entertainer in his prosperous days. He did
his work cheerfully and bore up without complaint against
misfortune and suffering such as few men are called upon to
endure.</p>

<p class="indent">As a poet he was fluent, vigorous, and spirited, but usually
paid little attention to form and polish. He made no effort
to become a careful writer; but this is sometimes compensated
for by a certain robustness which most of his verses
possess. His poetical genius is best shown in narrative, where
the movement is rapid and the action full of exciting moments.
If his poems lack intense passion and deep meditation, they
are at least picturesque and interesting.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_WORDSWORTH" id="WILLIAM_WORDSWORTH">WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</a></h2>

<p class="indent">William Wordsworth was born in 1770 at Cockermouth on
the borders of the beautiful English lake country. During a
boyhood spent largely out of doors, rowing, walking, and
skating, he imbibed a love for nature which had a broader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
manifestation in his later life and poetry. After a short period
at Hawkshead School, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge,
where he took a degree in 1791. He then resided for a time
in France; but was driven from there in 1793 by the Reign of
Terror, and passed a few years in a rather idle way in the
vicinity of London. His real poetic awakening came in 1797,
when he and Coleridge lived near each other at Alfoxden
among the Quantock Hills in Somerset. Here, in 1798, the
two young men published <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, a collection of poems
written for the most part by Wordsworth, though Coleridge contributed
<i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> and a few others.
This book, especially in its treatment of nature, was a reaction
against the stilted formalism which had characterized
much of the English poetry of the eighteenth century, and as
such it was the real stimulus for the revival of Romanticism
which followed its appearance. After a year in Germany with
his sister Dorothy, Wordsworth returned to the lake region
now associated with his name, living at Grasmere until 1813,
and after that at Rydal Mount. He married his cousin, Mary
Hutchinson, in 1802. Among his later important works were
<i>The Prelude</i> (1805), <i>The Excursion</i> (1814), and many shorter
poems and sonnets. He was made poet-laureate in 1843,
and died seven years after in 1850.</p>

<p class="indent">Wordsworth, though a radical in his youth, became more
conservative in later years. He was a man of quiet tastes,
and deliberately chose to live where he could be among simple
people. As a poet, he was first of all an interpreter of nature,
endowed with extraordinary keenness of observation and delighting
in all her phases. In humanity, too, he had a sympathetic
interest, especially in the everyday emotions and
occupations of the plain men and women around him. And
influencing his attitude toward both nature and humanity
was a sort of religious mysticism which conceived the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
God as permeating all things, flowers and trees as well as the
human heart.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Michael</span>
<a href="#Page_21">(Page 21)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Written in 1800 and published in the same year. Wordsworth's
own note on the poem is as follows: "Written at
Town-end, Grasmere, about the same time as 'The Brothers.'
The Sheepfold, on which so much of the poem turns, remains,
or rather the ruins of it. The character and circumstances of
Luke were taken from a family to whom had belonged, many
years before, the house we lived in at Town-end, along with
some fields and woodlands on the eastern shore of Grasmere.
The name of the Evening Star was not in fact given to this
house, but to another on the same side of the valley, more to
the north."</p>

<a href="#Page_36">(Page 36)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Written in 1799 and published first in 1800. Wordsworth
says of it: "Written at Goslar in Germany. It was founded
on a circumstance told me by my Sister, of a little girl, who,
not far from Halifax, in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a snowstorm.
Her footsteps were traced by her parents to the middle
of the lock of a canal, and no other vestige of her, backward
or forward, could be traced. The body, however, was found
in the canal."</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_CAMPBELL" id="THOMAS_CAMPBELL">THOMAS CAMPBELL</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Thomas Campbell was born at Glasgow, Scotland, July 27,
1777. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, where
he made somewhat of a reputation as a versifier and translator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
After some desultory attempts at tutoring, he published in
1799, <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>, a long didactic poem which
brought him real fame and a considerable financial reward.
Soon after he travelled on the continent, where many of his war
ballads were written. In his later days he was a figure in
literary circles and was given a pension by the crown. He
died in 1844 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class="indent">Much of Campbell's longer poetic work is dull and unequal.
However, in his own field of the vigorous patriotic ballad, he
is without a rival. Saintsbury says of him, "He holds the
place of best singer of war in a race and language which are
those of the best singers, and not the worst fighters, in the history
of the world."</p>

Copenhagen, April 2, 1801, between the English and the Danish
fleets. England had accepted a declaration of the Armed
Neutrality League (Russia, Denmark, and Sweden) as being
really in the interests of her enemy, France, and the English
fleet under Lord Parker was sent to the Baltic. Under Lord
Nelson, the second in command, a decisive victory was gained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
largely through the fact that Nelson refused to obey the orders

<h2><a name="LORD_BYRON" id="LORD_BYRON">BYRON</a></h2>

<p class="indent">George Gordon, Lord Byron, was born in London, January
22, 1788, and died at Missolonghi, April 19, 1824, at the age
of thirty-six. Byron's father, a captain in the guards, after a
romantic first marriage, wedded Catharine Gordon, a wealthy
girl, of Aberdeenshire, whom, after squandering her fortune,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
he deserted shortly after young Byron's birth. Byron's
mother was a quick-tempered, impulsive woman, ill-fitted to
bring up a son who had a temperament almost exactly like
her own. Once when a companion said to Byron, "Your
mother's a fool," the boy answered, "I know it."</p>

<p class="indent">As a boy at school Byron formed passionate attachments,
entered into the games he played with an unusual fierceness of
spirit, and exhibited that sensitive pride which was the cause
of much of his posing there and in later life. He was club-footed,
a deformity about which he was extremely sensitive.
Before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1805, he had
attended Harrow for five years. At Cambridge he remained
less than three years, but in that time made some close friends
and took an active part in all sorts of sports, especially riding
and swimming. His vacations he spent at London or Southwell,
generally quarrelling violently with his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">His first published poetry was <i>Hours of Idleness</i>, which
appeared in 1807, and which was attacked by the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> so strenuously that Byron replied in 1809 with <i>English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>. In the same year he took his
seat in the House of Lords, but he had no interest in politics,
and, accordingly, left England for two years' travel on the
continent. This tour was the occasion of the first two cantos
of <i>Childe Harold</i>. This poem was received so warmly that
Byron remarked that "he awoke one morning to find himself
famous." From now till the separation from his wife in 1816,
after a year of wedded life, he was the lion of British society,
but society took sides on this family difference, and as most
of them sympathized with Lady Byron, Byron himself left
England. He spent some time on Lake Geneva, where the
Castle of Chillon is situated. He then went to Italy, where,
amid his usual life of dissipation, he became interested in the
Italian Insurrection. Among his friends and companions in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Italy were Shelley and Leigh Hunt. In 1823, becoming attracted
by the attempts of the Greeks to overthrow Turkish
rule, he went to Greece as a leader, but he contracted a fever
at Missolonghi, where he died, April 19, 1824.</p>

<p class="indent">As a poet Byron appeals especially to youth. His tales are
so interesting that Scott made the remark that Byron beat
him at his own game. Rapidity and force of movement, intensity
and passion, excellent description, and a great, though
not fine, command of poetic sound are the chief characteristics
of his poetry. The romantic tale, <i>Childe Harold</i>, and the
satire, <i>Don Juan</i>, are perhaps his best-known works.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Prisoner of Chillon</span>
<a href="#Page_45">(Page 45)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">The castle of Chillon is situated near Montreux at the opposite
end of Lake Geneva from the city of Geneva. It is a
large castle, built on an isolated rock twenty-two yards from
the shore of the lake. Beneath this castle, but some nine or
ten feet above the surface of the lake, supported by seven
detached pillars and one semi-detached, is a vaulted chamber,
which was formerly used as a prison. Here, from 1530 to 1536,
was imprisoned Francis Bonnivard.</p>

<p class="indent">Bonnivard, the son of the Lord of Lune, was born in 1496.
When sixteen years old, he inherited from his uncle the priory
of St. Victor, near Geneva. Later he allied himself with this
city against the Duke of Savoy, but was captured and imprisoned
for two years in GrolÃ©e. In 1530 he again fell into the
hands of the Duke of Savoy, who this time confined him for six
years in Chillon castle. At the end of this period he was liberated
by the Bernese and Genevese and returned to Geneva to
live a brilliant but wild life until 1570.</p>

<p class="indent">Byron takes no pains to stick to the facts of Bonnivard's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
imprisonment or life, or even to the facts about the prison
itself. Notice, however, that he calls the poem "A Fable."</p>

<p class="indent">Byron and Shelley made a visit to Chillon in June, 1816,
and while delayed for two days at Ouchy, a village on Lake
Geneva, Byron wrote this poem.</p>

<p class="indent">Byron and Shelley belonged to a group of poets who were
influenced by the French Revolution. Byron's love of freedom
was so great that he aided Italy, and finally died from a fever
contracted at Missolonghi, where he had gone to aid the Greek
revolutionists. The following sonnet, which was prefixed to
<i>The Prisoner of Chillon</i>, gives an idea of Byron's love of liberty.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mazeppa</span>
<a href="#Page_58">(Page 58)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">The following extract from Voltaire's <i>History of Charles XII</i>
was prefixed to the first edition of <i>Mazeppa</i>
as the "Advertisement":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">"The man who then filled this position [Hetman of Ukraine]
was a Polish gentleman, named Mazeppa, who had been born
in the Palatinate of Podolia. He had been brought up as a
page to John Casimir, at whose court he had taken on some
of the color of learning. An intrigue which he had in his youth
with the wife of a Polish gentleman having been discovered,
the husband had him bound, all naked, upon a wild horse, and
in this condition let go. The horse, which was from the country
of Ukraine, returned and brought there Mazeppa, half-dead
with weariness and hunger. Some peasants helped him: he
remained a long time among them and distinguished himself
in several expeditions against the Tartars. The superiority
of his wisdom brought him great consideration among the
Cossacks. His reputation increased day by day, until the
Czar was obliged to make him Prince of Ukraine."</p>

<p class="indent">The real life of Mazeppa was as follows: Ivan StepÃ¡novitch
Mazeppa was born in 1645, of Cossack origin and of the lesser
nobility of Volhynia. When fifteen years old, he became the
page to John Casimir V of Poland, and, while holding this office,
learned Latin and much about statesmanship. Later, however,
being banished on account of a quarrel, he returned home to
his mother in Volhynia. While here, to pass the time, he fell
in love with the wife of a neighbor, Lord Falbouski. This
lord, or pane, discovering his wife and her lover, caused Mazeppa
to be stripped and bound to his own horse. The horse,
enraged by lashes and pistol shots and then let loose, ran immediately
to Mazeppa's own courtyard.</p>

<p class="indent">Mazeppa, later, after holding various secretaryships, was
made hetman, or prince, over all of Ukraine, and for nearly
twenty years he was the ally of Peter the Great. Afterwards,
however, he offered his services to Stanislaus of Poland, and
finally to Charles XII of Sweden. "Pultowa's Day," July 8,
1709, when Charles was defeated by the Russians and put to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
flight, was the last of Mazeppa's power. He fled with Charles
across the river Borysthenes and received protection from the
Turks. He died a year later at Varnitza on the Dneister, just
in time to escape being delivered over to Peter.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_KEATS" id="JOHN_KEATS">JOHN KEATS</a></h2>

<p class="indent">John Keats was born October, 1795, and died on the 23d of
February, 1821. He was the son of a livery-stable keeper, who
had married his former proprietor's daughter. The parents
had wished to educate Keats and his two brothers, but before
Keats was fifteen, both his father and mother had died. He was
then apprenticed to a surgeon at Edmonton, under whom he
remained four years, and then went up to London to complete
his training for a medical degree. This he received in due time
and began to practise, but he found literature so much more
attractive that, in about a year, he gave up his attempt to
practise medicine. At about this time he became acquainted
with Leigh Hunt, who had a good deal of influence upon Keats's
literary beginnings. His first volume of poetry, which appeared
in 1817, shows this influence strongly. A year later his <i>Endymion</i>
was published and was so severely criticised by <i>Blackwood's</i>
and especially by the <i>Quarterly</i> that Keats took it much
to heart; some have supposed that this attack very much hastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
his death. His brother George had moved to America
in 1818, and his brother Tom was now dying with consumption.
Keats nursed him faithfully until his death. Immediately
after this sorrow, he fell deeply in love, but his health was so
greatly impaired that he found it necessary, in 1820, to take a
trip to Italy. He did not grow stronger, however, but died
at Rome on the 23d of February, 1821.</p>

<p class="indent">Keats's poetry is noted especially for its sensuous beauty,
its descriptions, and its remarkable reproduction of the Greek
and romantic spirits.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Eve of St. Agnes</span>
<a href="#Page_88">(Page 88)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Around St. Agnes' Eve, which is the night before the Feast
of St. Agnes on January 21, and which corresponds to the
Scotch "Hallowe'en," there grew up the superstition that a
maiden could, by observing certain traditional precautions,
have in her sleep a vision of her future husband. Perhaps the
most common way to obtain this vision was for the girl to go to
sleep on her back with her hands behind her head; then at
midnight she would dream that her lover came and kissed her.
This is the superstition that Keats has made use of in <i>The Eve
of St. Agnes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">St. Agnes was a Roman girl, who at thirteen was loved by
the son of a Roman prefect, but, however, being like her parents
a Christian and having vowed virginity, she told her lover
that she was already betrothed. The youth, thinking he had
some earthly rival, as a result fell so very sick that his father
tried to intercede with the girl's parents. When he found these
people were Christians, he tried to compel Agnes to become a
vestal virgin or marry his son. Agnes, because she refused
to do either of these things, was dragged to the altar, but because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
here, by her prayers, she restored to her lover the sight
which he had lost, she was set free by the Prefect. The people,
however, tried to burn her, but were themselves consumed in
the fire, until finally one of their number slew her with his
sword. A few days after her death, her parents had a vision of
her, surrounded by angels and accompanied by a lamb (Agnus
Dei). After her canonization it was customary to sacrifice on
St. Agnes' Day, during the singing, two lambs whose wool the
next day was woven by the nuns into pallia for the archbishops.

<h2><a name="ALFRED_TENNYSON" id="ALFRED_TENNYSON">ALFRED TENNYSON</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Alfred Tennyson was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire,
England, on August 6, 1809, and died at Aldworth in Surrey
in 1892. He was the third of twelve brothers and sisters,
several of whom later showed evidences of genius. As early
as 1827 he and his brother Charles published <i>Poems by Two
Brothers</i>, for which they received ten pounds. At Trinity
College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1828, he won the
chancellor's gold medal for a prize poem <i>Timbuctoo</i>. On
the death of his father in 1831 he left Cambridge without a
degree. Before this in 1830 he had published <i>Poems, chiefly
Lyrical</i>, and two years later in 1832 a new volume appeared
which was severely criticised, though it contained much excellent
work. The death of his close friend, Arthur Henry Hallam,
in 1833 was a terrible blow to Tennyson and one from which
it took him many years to recover. It was, however, the
inspiration for his elegy <i>In Memoriam</i>, written for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
part during the period when the loss was felt most keenly.
For some time after, Tennyson lived quietly, gaining in power
and expression, and busy training himself for the future. The
product of this seclusion came in two volumes of poetry, printed
in 1842, which were enthusiastically greeted. In 1845 Wordsworth
wrote, "Tennyson is decidedly the first of our living
poets." <i>The Princess; A Medley</i>, appeared in 1847, and three
years later he gave to the world the completed <i>In Memoriam</i>.
This same year (1850) is also notable for his marriage with Miss
Emily Sellwood and his appointment as poet-laureate in place
of Wordsworth, who had just died.</p>

<p class="indent">From this time on his place in literature was secured, and he
lived a happy life, making occasional short trips in England
and on the continent, but remaining for the most part quietly
at his estate on the Isle of Wight. Among his later works
are <i>Maud</i> (1855), <i>Enoch Arden</i> (1864),
<i>Idylls of the King</i>
(finished 1872), a group of <i>Ballads, and Other Poems</i> (1880),
and several dramas. He accepted a peerage in 1883. Nine
years later he died and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class="indent">Tennyson, in the range and scope of his work, in the variety
of his interests, and in the versatility of his art, is the most
representative poet of the nineteenth century. He tried many
kinds of poetry and met with some success in all. He learned
versification as Stevenson did his prose style, by long-continued
study and practice, with the result that he became eventually
a supreme literary artist, a master of melody in words. His
diction is admirably precise and exact, and he is easy to read and
understand. While he is rarely profound or searching, like
Browning, neither is he overintellectual; but he embeds sane
and safe thought in a mould of beauty. He was a national
poet in his patriotism and fondness for English scenery. Finally
he was an apostle of religious optimism, ready to combat the
morbid beliefs which were disturbing contemporary philosophy.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dora</span>
<a href="#Page_103">(Page 103)</a></h4>
<p class="indent">Published in 1842.</p>

<p class="indent">The clearness and simplicity of this exquisite pastoral make
any explanatory notes superfluous. Regarding it, Wordsworth
once said to Tennyson, "I have been endeavoring all
my life to write a pastoral like your Dora and have not yet
succeeded."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">&OElig;none</span>
<a href="#Page_108">(Page 108)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Most of this poem was written in 1830 while Tennyson
was travelling in the Pyrenees Mountains with his friend,
Arthur Henry Hallam. The descriptions of scenery belong,
therefore, to that district, and not to the vicinity of ancient
Troy. <i>&OElig;none</i> was first published in 1832, but was afterward
frequently revised; it appears here in the final form approved
by Tennyson himself.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Revenge</span>
<a href="#Page_146">(Page 146)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Published first in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, March, 1878.
Reprinted in <i>Ballads, and other Poems</i>, 1880.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Revenge</i> deals with an incident of the war between
England and Spain during the latter half of the sixteenth century.
Sir Richard Grenville, the hero, came from a long line
of fighters and was one of the most famous naval commanders
of the period. He had led, in 1585, the first English colony
to Virginia, and had been in charge of the Devon coast defence
at the time of the <i>Armada</i> (1588) when that great Spanish
fleet, organized to deal a crushing blow to England, was defeated
and almost entirely destroyed by English ships and
seamen under Lord Howard and Sir Francis Drake. In 1591
he was given command of the <i>Revenge</i>, a second-rate ship of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
hundred tons' burden and carrying a crew of two hundred and
fifty men, and sent to the Azores to intercept a Spanish treasure
fleet. While there, he was cut off from his own squadron and
left with two alternatives: to turn his back on the enemy, or to
sail through the fifty-three Spanish vessels opposed to him.
He refused to retreat, and the terrible battle described in the
ballad was the result.</p>

<p class="indent">Grenville was a somewhat haughty and tyrannical leader,
though noble-minded, loyal, and patriotic. In Charles Kingsley's
<i>Westward Ho!</i> which gives a vivid portrayal of English
national feeling and character during these stirring times, he
is made to take an important part, and is idealized as "a truly
heroic personage&mdash;a steadfast, God-fearing, chivalrous man,
conscious (as far as a soul so healthy could be conscious) of
the pride of beauty, and strength, and valour, and wisdom."
Froude calls him "a goodly and gallant gentleman." Perhaps
the best comment on him is found in his own dying words:
"Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind:
for that I have ended my life as true soldier ought to do, that
hath fought for his country, Queen, religion, and honour.
Whereby my soul most joyfully departeth out of this body,
and shall always leave behind it an everlasting fame of a
valiant and true soldier; that hath done his dutie as he was
bound to do."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Revenge</i> is styled by Stevenson (the <i>English Admirals</i>)
"one of the noblest ballads in the English language." Indeed,
in vigor of spirit, and in patriotic feeling, there are few
poems which surpass it.</p>

<h2><a name="ROBERT_BROWNING" id="ROBERT_BROWNING">ROBERT BROWNING</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Robert Browning was born at Camberwell, May 7, 1812,
and died at Venice, December 12, 1889. Browning's father, as
his grandfather had been, was employed in the Bank of England.
Mr. Browning, who was an indulgent father, decided
that his son's education should be under private tutors. This
lack of being educated with other boys is sometimes supposed
to have been one of the causes why Browning found difficulty
in expressing his thoughts clearly to other people. It was
at first planned that Browning should become a lawyer, but
as he had no taste for this, his father agreed to allow his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
son to adopt literature as a profession. When Browning
had made his choice, he read Johnson's Dictionary for
preparation. <i>Pauline</i>, his first published poem, attracted
almost no attention, but Browning kept on writing, regardless
of inattention. The actor, Macready, with whom he became
friendly, turned Browning's attention to the writing of plays,
but he was never successful as a writer for the stage. On his
return from his second visit to Italy, in 1844, he read Miss
Elizabeth Barrett's <i>Lady Geraldine's Courtship</i> and expressed
so much appreciation of this poem that, on the suggestion of
a common friend, he wrote to tell Miss Barrett how much he
liked her work. This was the beginning of one of the famous
literary love affairs of the world. Although Miss Barrett was
several years older than Browning and a great invalid, they
were married, against family opposition, in 1846, and went
immediately to Italy. Mrs. Browning's health was now
much improved, and she lived till 1861. On her death,
Browning, greatly overcome, returned to England. Gradually
he went more and more into society, and as his popularity
as a poet increased, he became a well-known figure in public.
He continued writing throughout his life. He died at his son's
house in Venice in 1889.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How they brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix</span>
<a href="#Page_154">(Page 154)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Browning wrote concerning this poem: "There is no sort
of historical foundation about <i>Good News from Ghent</i>. I
wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast,
after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the
fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain good horse 'York'
then in my stable at home. It was written in pencil on the
fly-leaf of Bartoli's <i>Simboli</i>, I remember." Such an incident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
might, of course, have happened at the "Pacification of Ghent,"
a treaty of union between Holland, Zealand, and southern
Netherlands under William of Orange, against Philip II of
Spain. The distance between Ghent and Aix as mapped out
in this poem is something more than ninety miles. Do you
think a horse could gallop that distance? Notice that the
verse gives the effect of galloping.</p>

of Man</i>, written by Nathaniel Wanley and published in
1678. This poem, however, from whatever source the story
was taken, was deservedly popular long before Browning himself
was. It was written to amuse, during a sickness, the son
of William Macready, the most prominent English actor of
his time and a close friend of Browning's.</p>

<h2><a name="DANTE_GABRIEL_ROSSETTI" id="DANTE_GABRIEL_ROSSETTI">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI</a></h2>

<p class="indent">Dante Gabriel Rossetti was born in London, of Italian
parentage, in 1828. He was educated at King's College School,
but became very early a student of painting, in which art he
attained considerable prominence. He was a member of the
famous pre-Raphaelite group of artists and authors, and was
largely responsible for the movement started by them. In
1861 he published <i>The Early Italian Poets</i>, a volume of
translations; in 1870, <i>Poems</i>; and in 1881, <i>Ballads and
Sonnets</i>. His last days were unhappy, his death in 1882 being
hastened by overindulgence in narcotics.</p>

<p class="indent">Rossetti's painting had a marked effect upon his poetry,
chiefly in giving him the faculty of vivid and ornate description.
Though essentially a lyric poet, he revived old English
ballad forms with much success, and his narrative poems are
vigorous and spirited. A good short life of Rossetti is that
by Joseph Knight in the Great Writers Series.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The White Ship</span>
<a href="#Page_175">(Page 175)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">First published in 1881 in the volume called <i>Ballads and
Sonnets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Henry the First, the third son of William the Conqueror
had, on the death of his brother William the Second (William
Rufus) in 1100, seized the crown of England by force from his
other elder brother, Robert, Duke of Normandy. In 1106,
after overthrowing Robert at Tenchebray, he became also
Duke of Normandy, thus uniting under himself the two nations.
This bond of union he further strengthened by marrying
Mathilda, an English princess. His reign, which lasted until
1135, marked a revival in English national feeling, and a long
step was taken toward the assimilation of the victorious Normans
by the people whom they had conquered.</p>

<p class="indent">Henry and Mathilda had only one son, William, who was
born in 1103. The following account of his death is given
by William of Malmesbury (edited by J. C. Giles): "Giving
orders for returning to England, the king set sail from Barfleur
just before twilight on the seventh before the kalends of
December; and the breeze which filled his sails conducted
him safely to his kingdom and extensive fortunes. But the
young prince, who was now somewhat more than seventeen
years of age, and, by his father's indulgence, possessed everything
but the name of king, commanded another vessel to be
prepared for himself; almost all the young nobility flocking
around him, from similarity of youthful pursuits. The sailors,
too, immoderately filled with wine, with that seaman's hilarity
which their cups excited, exclaimed, that those who were
now ahead must soon be left astern; for the ship was of the
best construction and recently fitted with new materials.
When, therefore, it was now dark night, these imprudent
youths, overwhelmed with liquor, launched the vessel from
the shore.... The carelessness of the intoxicated crew drove
her on a rock which rose above the waves not far from shore....
The oars, dashing, horribly crashed against the rock, and her
battered prow hung immovably fixed. Now, too, the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
washed some of the crew overboard, and, entering the chinks,
drowned others; when the boat having been launched, the
young prince was received into it, and might certainly have
been saved by reaching the shore, had not his illegitimate
sister, the Countess of Perche, now struggling with death in
the larger vessel, implored her brother's assistance. Touched
with pity, he ordered the boat to return to the ship, that he
might rescue his sister; and thus the unhappy youth met his
death through excess of affection; for the skiff, overcharged
by the multitudes who leaped into her, sank, and buried all
indiscriminately in the deep. One rustic alone escaped; who,
floating all night upon the mast, related in the morning the
dismal catastrophe of the tragedy."</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_MORRIS" id="WILLIAM_MORRIS">WILLIAM MORRIS</a></h2>

<p class="indent">William Morris was born in 1834 in Walthamstead, Essex,
England, and died in London in 1896. He went to Exeter
College, Oxford, in 1853, where he formed a close friendship
with Edward Burne-Jones, the future artist. A little later he
came under the influence of Rossetti, who induced him to
attempt painting, an art which he followed with no great
success. In 1858 he published <i>The Defence of Guinevere, and
Other Poems</i>. This volume was followed by <i>The Life and
Death of Jason</i> (1867), <i>The Earthly Paradise</i> (finished 1872),
and <i>Sigurd the Volsung</i> (1876). In 1863 he became a manufacturer
of wall paper and artistic furniture, branching out
afterwards into weaving, dyeing, and other crafts. After 1885
he was a confirmed Socialist, speaking frequently at laborers'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
meetings and pouring forth a steady stream of leaflets and
pamphlets in support of his radical beliefs. His death was
probably due to overwork.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was by instinct a lover of the beautiful and harmonious.
A fluent versifier, he delighted especially in the
composition of narrative poetry, which he adorned with ornate
description and superb decoration. This very richness sometimes
cloys the taste and tends to arouse a feeling of monotony.
His longest work, <i>The Earthly Paradise</i>, is modelled somewhat
on Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, and contains twenty-four stories,
twelve mediÃ¦val and twelve classic in origin.</p>

<p class="indent">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine,
on February 27, 1807. He entered Bowdoin College at the
early age of fifteen, graduating there in 1825. He then spent
about three years abroad preparing himself for a position, as
Professor of Modern Languages at Bowdoin, which he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
on his return. There he remained six years, leaving in 1834
to become a professor in Harvard College. His first book of
poems, <i>Voices of the Night</i>, appeared in 1839, and two years
later he published <i>Ballads and other Poems</i>. Both volumes
were received cordially and had a wide circulation. Other
important later works were <i>Evangeline</i> (1847), <i>Hiawatha</i>
(1855), <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i> (1858), and <i>Tales of a
Wayside Inn</i> (finished 1873). In 1854 he left off teaching and
settled down to a quiet literary life. During a trip to Europe
in 1868 he was given honorary degrees by both Oxford and
Cambridge. He died in Boston in 1882. It is a testimonial
to his popularity in England that his bust was placed in the
Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, the only memorial to an
American author there.</p>

<p class="indent">Longfellow was a scholarly and cultured poet, influenced
much by foreign literatures and proficient in translation.
His verse is rarely impassioned, but is usually simple, smooth,
and polished. America has had no finer narrative poet; and
it is unquestionable that this form of poetry was well adapted
to his genius, which was fluent, but not often strongly emotional.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Wreck of the Hesperus</span>
<a href="#Page_211">(Page 211)</a></h4>

<p class="indent">Longfellow's diary for the date December 17, 1839, contains
the following entry: "News of shipwrecks horrible on the
coast. Twenty bodies washed ashore near Gloucester, one
lashed to a piece of wreck. There is a reef called Norman's
Woe, where many of these took place; among others the
schooner Hesperus&mdash;I must write a ballad upon this." Two
weeks later he wrote: "I sat last evening till twelve o'clock
by my fire, smoking, when suddenly it came into my mind to
write the 'Ballad of the Schooner Hesperus,' which I accordingly
did. Then I went to bed, but I could not sleep. New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
thoughts were running in my mind, and I got up to add them
to the ballad. It was three by the clock. I then went to bed and
fell asleep. I feel pleased with the ballad. It hardly cost me an
effort. It did not come into my mind by lines, but by stanzas."</p>

<p class="indent">General Gage, commander of the British forces in Boston
and vicinity, despatched, on the night of April 18, 1775, a body
of troops to seize stores said to be concealed at Concord. According
to the story, Paul Revere spread the warning throughout
the surrounding country, and when the British arrived at
Lexington they found a small body of militia lined up to oppose
them. A skirmish ensued in which the first blood of the war
was spilled, several being killed and others wounded.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_GREENLEAF_WHITTIER" id="JOHN_GREENLEAF_WHITTIER">JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</a></h2>

<p class="indent">John Greenleaf Whittier was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts,
December 17, 1807, and died at Hampton Falls, New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Hampshire, September 7, 1892. Whittier's ancestors for several
generations had been New England farmers on the same farm
where the original Whittier immigrant had settled. The family
was too poor to give Whittier an education, so that two terms at
Haverhill Academy, the tuition for which he paid by shoemaking
and school teaching, completed his school training. He early
became interested in journalism, and was employed in editorial
work in Boston and in Hartford. When abolition became an
agitation, Whittier became one of the leaders. He was instrumental
in bringing the English Abolitionist, George Thompson,
to America; and, while on a tour with him, was stoned and
shot at by a mob in Concord, New Hampshire. Later, when
he was editor of the <i>Philadelphia Freeman</i>, his office was burned
by a mob. During this period he wrote many anti-slavery
poems, such as the <i>Ballads</i>, <i>Anti-Slavery Poems</i>, etc., of
1838 and the <i>Voices of Freedom</i> of 1841. In spite of his interest
in politics, for he was twice elected to the Massachusetts legislature,
Whittier led a very simple life in accordance with his
Quaker beliefs. He never married, partly, it seems, because
he had the care of his mother and sister Elizabeth, until the
latter's death in 1864. The latter part of his life he lived at
Amesbury and Danvers, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="indent">Whittier's poetry is of three kinds. He is at times more
thoroughly than any other writer the poet of New England
country life; again he is essentially an anti-slavery poet; and,
finally, he has written many religious poems. His best-known
poem is <i>Snow-Bound</i>, which gives an admirable picture of a
farmer's life in the hard storms of a New England winter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Among the earliest converts to the doctrines of the Friends
in Scotland was Barclay of Ury, an old and distinguished
soldier, who had fought under Gustavus Adolphus, in Germany.
As a Quaker, he became the object of persecution and abuse
at the hands of the magistrates and populace. None bore the
indignities of the mob with greater patience and nobleness of
soul than this once proud gentleman and soldier. One of his
friends, on an occasion of uncommon rudeness, lamented that
he should be treated so harshly in his old age who had been so
honored before. 'I find more satisfaction,' said Barclay,
'as well as honor, in being thus insulted for my religious principles,
than when, a few years ago, it was usual for the magistrates,
as I passed the city of Aberdeen, to meet me on the road
and conduct me to public entertainment in their hall, and then

was no myth, but a worthy and highly esteemed gentlewoman,
intensely loyal and a hater of the Slavery Rebellion, holding
her Union flag sacred and keeping it with her Bible; that when
the Confederates halted before her house, and entered her dooryard,
she denounced them in vigorous language, shook her
cane in their faces, and drove them out; and when General
Burnside's troops followed close upon Jackson's, she waved her
flag and cheered them. It is stated that May Quantrell, a
brave and loyal lady in another part of the city, did wave her
flag in sight of the Confederates. It is possible that there has
been a blending of the two incidents."<br />

<p class="indent">Oliver Wendell Holmes was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
in 1809. He studied at Phillips Academy, Andover, and later at
Harvard College, where he graduated in the famous class of 1829.
He tried law for a year, but gave this up for medicine. In 1833
he went abroad, returning in 1835 for a medical degree at Harvard.
He at once began the active practice of his profession,
but accepted a professorship at Dartmouth in 1838. He remained
there only a short time, coming back again to Boston,
where he married and resumed his work as a physician. In
1847 he became Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology
at Harvard, and held this position until 1882. In 1857,
through the influence of James Russell Lowell, he began to
contribute regularly to the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. After 1882 he
devoted himself almost exclusively to writing and lecturing.
He died in 1894 in Boston.</p>

<p class="indent">While Holmes is best known as the author of <i>The Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table</i> and other prose works, he published
numerous poems, most of them humorous in tone. Many of
them were written for specific occasions, and as such are
distinguished for their wit and cleverness rather than for strong
emotion or profound thought.</p>

five thousand British soldiers under Howe, Clinton, and Pigott
attacked a smaller number of Americans then stationed on
Breed's Hill near Boston, under Colonel William Prescott.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
They were twice beaten back, but captured the hill on their
third charge. The British loss was about twelve hundred men,
while the Americans lost only four hundred, among them,
however, being the patriot, Dr. Joseph Warren.</p>
